## Customization Guide

Follow these steps to replace the example information with your own:

### 1. Update Personal Information
- **Hero Section**: 
  - In `index.html`, replace `"Aminul Islam"` and `"Senior Executive, Voice of Customer Management"` in the `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags to add your name and title.
  
  ```html
  <h1 class="glitch" data-text="Your Name">Your Name</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">Your Job Title</h2>
  ```

- **About Section**: 
  - Update the text in the `#about` section to add your biography or introduction.

- **Experience Section**: 
  - Modify or add new timeline items in the `#experience` section by following the existing structure. Replace job roles, dates, and descriptions with your details.

### 2. Customize Skills and Achievements
- **Skills Section**: 
  - In `index.html`, find the `#skills` section and add or update rows in the table.
  ```html
  <tr>
      <td>Your Skill Category</td>
      <td>
          <ul>
              <li>Specific Skill #1</li>
              <li>Specific Skill #2</li>
              <li>Specific Skill #3</li>
          </ul>
      </td>
  </tr>
  ```

- **Achievements Section**: 
  - Add or edit achievement items in the `#achievements` section. Each achievement is a `<div>` with a title and description.

### 3. Replace Images
- **Profile Picture**: 
  - In `styles.css`, replace the URL in `.hero-image` with your own image:
    ```css
    .hero-image {
        background-image: url('your-image-url.jpg');
    }
    ```

- **Company Logos**: 
  - In `index.html`, update the `<img>` tags in the `#experience` section with the logos of your past companies.

### 4. Contact Form
The contact form currently validates input but doesn't send emails. To make it functional:
- Use a service like **Formspree**, **EmailJS**, or connect it to your backend server.
- Replace the `console.log` in `script.js` with your form submission logic.

### 5. Change Design and Colors
- Open `styles.css` and update the `:root` variables to customize the colors:
  ```css
  :root {
      --primary-color: #your-color-code;
      --secondary-color: #your-secondary-color-code;
  }
  ```
- Fonts can be replaced by updating the `<link>` in `index.html` to another Google Font.

## How It Works

- **HTML** (`index.html`): Contains the structure of the website.
- **CSS** (`styles.css`): Handles the visual design, including animations and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** (`script.js`): Adds interactivity, such as the burger menu, smooth scrolling, modal popups, and form validation.
